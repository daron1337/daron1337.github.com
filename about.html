<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>I'm a software engineer working as a researcher in the Medical Imaging Unit of the Biomedical Engineering Department of the Mario Negri Institute, a no-profit italian research organization. 
My working interests are focused on software design and code developing, 1D and 3D computational fluid dynamics, reconstruction, geometric analysis, mesh generation and surface data analysis for image-based 
modelling of blood vessels. I'm currently the main developer of pyNS, an open-source framework for 0D/1D haemodynamic computational modelling.</p> 
<p>Since the beginning of 2011 I started to work as freelancer for Orobix Srl.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m based in Bergamo, Italy. You can reach me at simone (dot) manini (at) gmail (dot) com.</p>
